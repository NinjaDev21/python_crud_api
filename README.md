# Preparing your workspace

Preparing your workspace is one of the first things that you can do to make sure that you start off well. 

The first step is to check your working directory.When you are working in the Python terminal, 

you need first navigate to the directory, where your file is located and then start up Python,

i.e., you have to make sure that your file is located in the directory where you want to work from.

For this Python REST API CRUD Example using Flask and MySQL, we need modules, such as, flask and mysql. 
The module flask works as a web framework and mysql module is required to establish connection with MySQL database and 
query the database using Python programming language.

#SETUP 

Python API for CRUD and search operation using mysql database.

1. Install python (if not present in the system ).

4. Create the database table 
	
	# get the create table query from create_table file 

5. Run the program 
	
	# go to the directory and run the main.py file ---- # python main.py 

6. Sent or retrive the values from postmark to test the API.
